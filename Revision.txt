Essentials of AWS and Cloud Computing: 
What is DCaaS?

What is a pub service and a pvt service? and what is the difference between public and pvt services? 
public services: s3(can restrict access) dbms(can launch in pvt sn so only pvt instances can access db), sns and sqs
private service: VPC

public cloud: anyone can create an account and start using the services(with vpc help we can restrict access to the resources)
aws
gcp
azure
==yes

private cloud: similar to public cloud, but not accessible by everyone only to organization(security similar to on-prem, usage similar to pub. costly compared to pvt cloud). 


on-premise dc: VMWare 
-- we purchase from vendor and install the infra at organization location then purchase software license and use software to manage the resources/infra.
-- or we purchase infra and software from vmware itself????
openstack
-- we purchase and install the infra from vendor and use free software license to manage the resources/infra  -> called as on-premise/private cloud.

================
inline policy gets deleted when the attached user is deleted??????????/

say user has rds policy attached, and role with ec2. now without role he can only rds, with role he can only access ec2. check???????????/
