COMMANDS: 

Installing nginix on ubuntu: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04
sudo apt update; sudo apt install -y nginix; sudo systemctl status nginix
sudo systemctl start/stop/restart/reload/disable/enable nginx

Installing nginix on Amazon linux: 
sudo yum update; sudo yum install -y nginix; sudo systemctl status nginix
For mounting an EBS Volume: 
mkdir mount-folder; mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf; mount /dev/xvdf mount-folder			# if not works try with sudo 
umount /dev/xvdf  																	# for unmounting
lsblk																				# to know the devices mounted.

For mounting an EFS: (for ec2 - need to have NFS/ALL traffic in the outbound; for efs mountpoint sg - need to have NFS traffic in inbound and ALL traffic in outbound)
apt install nfs-common																#for ubuntu
yum install -y nfs-utils															#for rhel


==================================================================================================================================================================

VERIFY THESE AGAIN: 

FOR EC2: 
create ec2 instance attach a ebs vol, mkfs, mount, add content, upgrade ebs volume, add content, umount, upgrade ebs volume, attach, add content, mkfs.
sg-ec2: inbound ssh, outbound all traffic  ;   sg-efs: inbound ebs related traffic, outbound all traffic.

create amazon linux, ubuntu, rhel, create efs with 2 mountpoints, mount for all 3 instances, add content in one instance and check for the content reflection in other instances.
sg-ec2: inbound ssh, outbound all trafic   ;   sg-fsx: inbound NFS traffic, outbound all traffic.

perform FSX assignment once more
FSX traffic is SMB.
sg attached for liux instance has inbound all tcp

under additonal config, enable deletion restrict and try with root use and peer iam user

created a ec2 with comp_lap.pem, now i have to ssh, then instead of direct comp_lap.pem, i have used copy.pem with same content. will it login???
how to user user data option in ec2?
#bin/bash
echo "hai" > /home/sample

how to create ami, if the ec2 has 2ebs attached

where exacty the pvt key stored on ec2, which we selected via console????
/etc/ssh/

one doubt, related to creating ebs volume from a snapshot
we create snapshot from 4gb ebs volume, then if we are creating volume from the created snapshot should we go >=4gb only? If we go <4gb then we may loss data, is this allowed(like decreasing ebs volume size)

EFS: 
If mountpoint is not created in one az then we can mount the instances of those with EFS.
just a thought, a mount point is created witin a az means within subnet. so it takes an ip from subnet cidr itself.
then within route table internal route entry, why the mounting can't happen?



NEED TO KNOW - 
can u explain about hibernate mode and billing under hibernate mode?

Where all can Elastic ip is used? 
NAT ok, ec2 any ENI.

say we have made an ami, and we want to make it publicly available. how we do it?

can we add the elastic ip to any ec2 instance at the time of creation or after creation???
If elastic ip is created and not attached to anyone then it is chargable?? yes
If elastic ip is created billing starts? no
If elastic ip is created and attached to anyone then it is not chargable?? no

scaling up is fine, how scaling down works????
created a volume of 4gb and attached to ec2, filled with data of 3gb. Now we reduced size of data to 2gb then data will be lost?
EBS volume can only be increased, no decrease happens

1ebs with 2diff ec2 - is possible only for provisioned iops - 1o volume1,

any recommended folder for Linux systems under which we need to mount a ebs


ADDITIONAL INFO: 
vpc: 
security group is said to maintain state. 
Lets say if we put inbound as only ssh, and in outbound as all traffic allowed. 
Then by loggin into ec2 via ssh and we tried to install ansible/jenkins software which done over internet that include http/https protocol. 

Now eventhough in inbound there is no rule for allowing traffic for http/https protocol, ec2 can accept this traffic. 
This is because security group is maintaining state. 

So, when a traffic is initiated by ec2(since all traffic is allowed, traffic will go out from ec2), 
now response for this traffic is reached to ec2 on same/some other port which is not mentioned in inbound rules, 
here still the communication will be success as SG is maintaining state/channel for receiving traffic for traffic initiated.

====================================================================================================================================================================================

FOR IAM: 
Importance of role.
say I have requirement to give ec2 full access to a user, generally we do it by adding ec2 full access policy to the user, 
(the recomendded way is to create a group with ec2 full access and add user to the group.)

Now, we can do the same by creating a role with ec2 full access policy and assign role to user. 

If we do it, by
providing access to user by directly by attaching policy, here he can directly access after logged into console.
providing access to user by asigning role, here he cant directly access ec2 after logged into console, he again need to swith role to have ec2 full access. 

I could see difference between using/accessing the assigned permissions/policies to the user by above two methods. 

What should be the conceptual difference/main intenetion we need to understand by above two methods?


Note: I knew that we can use roles to directly attach to a service(like ec2) to provide full access for ec2 over other services(like s3).(here we create role with s3 full access policy and assign role to ec2)
Since we are providing access for a service we have to go by roles there is no other way(correct me if i am wrong). If it was user we can go by user/role method. 



permissions attached to user and also a role attached to user, Now role also have some permissions attached.
Now when using role, does the permission attached to user will have their effect? or just the role permissions are activated.
lets say user has 5 permissions/policies attached. 
and we have created a role and attached 3 permissions/policies 

Now when the user logged in normally then he is having 5 permissions attached, (here he cant use 3 permissions attached for the role)==yes, confirmed
then if he switched role then he has only 3 permission attached. (here he cant use 5 permissions attached for the role)==yes, confirmed


clear picture on accesskey and acces tokens.

If allow and deny are attached then which will work? i think deny will work.

exact need for aws configure, i.e., configureing aws user and access key for the ec2 logged in user to access s3 buckets.

NEED TO KNOW - 
Active directory role in IAM.
